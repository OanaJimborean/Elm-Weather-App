-- TYPE MISMATCH -------- D:\AN3_SEMESTRUL1\FP_Lab\Assignment1\src\View\Week.elm

The 1st argument to `view` is not what I expect:

26|         h2[][View.Day.view (List.head weekly.dailyData)] 
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This `head` call produces:

    Maybe DailyData

But `view` needs the 1st argument to be:

    DailyData

Hint: Use Maybe.withDefault to handle possible errors. Longer term, it is
usually better to write out the full `case` though!

The 1st argument to `view` is not what I expect:

32|         h2[][View.Day.view (List.head (List.reverse weekly.dailyData))]
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This `head` call produces:

    Maybe DailyData

But `view` needs the 1st argument to be:

    DailyData

Hint: Use Maybe.withDefault to handle possible errors. Longer term, it is

The 2nd argument to `map` is not what I expect:

29|         p[] <| List.map View.Day.view List.reverse(List.tail(List.reverse weekly.dailyData))
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^
This `reverse` value is a:

    List a -> List a

But `map` needs the 2nd argument to be:

    List DailyData

Hint: I always figure out the argument types from left to right. If an argument
is acceptable, I assume it is “correct” and move on. So the problem may actually
be in one of the previous arguments!

-- TOO MANY ARGS -------- D:\AN3_SEMESTRUL1\FP_Lab\Assignment1\src\View\Week.elm

The `map` function expects 2 arguments, but it got 3 instead.

29|         p[] <| List.map View.Day.view List.reverse(List.tail(List.reverse weekly.dailyData))
                   ^^^^^^^^
Are there any missing commas? Or missing parentheses?
